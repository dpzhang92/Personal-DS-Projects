This project was an exercise in trying to predict nominations and winner for Best Picture at the 2021 Oscars using past data, scraped from IMDB and using some Kaggle datasets. The resulting predictions were not very accurate given the nature of our dataset and feature selection, but some of the films predicted were at the Oscars in other categories.
